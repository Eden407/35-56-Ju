QA Begginers Detecting and Handling Bugs

What is a Bug?

A bug is anything in the software that doesn’t behave as expected. This can include:
	•	Crashes or freezes
	•	Wrong results or calculations
	•	UI problems (layout issues, missing elements)
	•	Buttons or features not responding
	•	Slow or strange behavior

How QA Detects a Bug
	1.	Explore and test features like a real user.
	2.	Watch for issues – is something off, broken, or confusing?
	3.	Try to reproduce the issue multiple times.
	4.	Document the bug:
	•	Clear steps to reproduce
	•	What you expected vs what happened
	•	Screenshots, screen recordings, logs
	•	Mention where it happened (device/browser/env)

How to Report a Bug

Use your team’s bug tracking system (like Jira). Include:
	•	Title: short and clear
	•	Description: steps, actual vs expected
	•	Attachments: screenshots/videos/logs
	•	Severity/Priority: how bad is it? Does it block users?

How Developers Might Respond
	1.	“I can’t reproduce it.”
→ Provide detailed steps or screen recording. Offer to walk through it.
	2.	“That’s expected behavior.”
→ Double-check design docs or ask the product team. If it feels wrong to a user, it still matters.
	3.	“It’s a known issue.”
→ Confirm it’s tracked somewhere. If it affects testing, mention it in reports.
	4.	“Works on my machine.”
→ Compare environments or test data. Try to narrow down what’s different.

Good QA Always Double-Checks Themselves
	•	Make sure it’s really a bug and not a misunderstanding.
	•	Test in different environments or devices if needed.
	•	Clear cache or re-login to eliminate edge cases.
	•	Ask: “Would a user find this confusing or frustrating?”
	•	Double-check before reporting — avoid false alarms.

Golden Tips
	•	Be detailed, clear, and calm.
	•	Your goal is to help the team build a better product.
	•	QA is not about blame — it’s about quality and user experience.
	•	Always re-test bugs after they are marked as fixed.
